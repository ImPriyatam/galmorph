GalMorph documentation
======================

Welcome to the GalMorph documentation page! 

GalMorph is a neat little function that morphologically categorizes galaxies from a numerical simulation dataset as spiral, elliptical or irregular. 

The package analyzes the probability values for the three morphologies to decide the type of each simulated galaxy.
